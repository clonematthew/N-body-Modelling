# N-body-Modelling

The development of an N-Body code used for my 3rd Year University Project.
This repository includes: 

1. An initial conditions generator.
2. An N-Body integrator.
3. A basic binary finder code.

The initial conditions generator is based on works by Andre et al (2010), Lada & Lada (2003) and Konyves & Andre (2016).
The N-Body code uses methods developed by Makino & Arseth (1992) and Kokubo et al (1997).
The Binary Finder uses methods and equations from Pavel Kroupa.

The codes are not finished and are subject to constant change.
